                <p>This is a fun game that can be played with 
                two players! Use wasd and the arrow keys
                one another. After selecting one of two 
                tracks, the players get to race to the end
                as fast as they can! Try not to touch the
                the green though, or else you'll slow down
                and lose!</p>

                    <p>This is yet another fun game that is
                        based around using your mouse to lead
                        a knight through a maze to find and 
                        save the princess from the castle!
                        Click your mouse to start, and press 
                        R to restart the level. </p>
